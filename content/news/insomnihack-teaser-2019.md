**Insomni'hack** is a security conference who take place in Geneva every year since 11 years. The 2019 edition will happen at the Palexpo Congress Center in Geneva on March 21 st & 22 nd 2019. The main Insomni'hack CTF contest will be held on March 22nd 2019, from 6 pm until 4 am the next morning. It will start shortly after the end of the conferences. Teams are limited to 8 participants, onsite only. People willing to participate will need to register but it will be free as always.

The CTF Teaser took place the weekend of the 19-20 of January. The challenge themes was pwn, web, crypto and reverse. I work alone (I don't have a CTF team and all my friend don't want to play) so I focused on the 4 web challenges but, sadly, I did not succeed in validating any of them but I have done some good research ! Then I will not publish write ups but only articles about vulnerability.

My two favorites challenges was : **l33t-hoster** and **exploit-space**
